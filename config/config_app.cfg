header = Instructions
description = The primary function of the assistant is to provide suggestions on what could logically follow 
    the code the user has written. To utilize this feature, the user must initially load or download the appropriate model. 
    Following this, the user should input the code they wish to extend. Upon pressing the "Generate" button, 
    the assistant will expand the code to the specified length (using a slider). If the user wishes to continue 
    expanding their code further, they can click "Move" to move the entire generated output back to the input field. 
    This allows for continuous code generation using the model. Enjoy your coding experience!
